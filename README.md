# README 

This repository contains notes for Flatiron School's London Campus PCA Lecture.
Original materials for this repository were created by [David John Baker](https://github.com/davidjohnbaker1).
Coding materials for this lesson were originally taken from [this exercise](https://data.world/exercises/pca-exercise-1-solutions) and have been modified.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the lesson, students should be able to: 

* [ ] Identify business cases when PCA is appropriate
* [ ] Give examples of when PCA could be used in domains beyond the lecture examples
* [ ] Explain why variables need to be standardized before conducting PCA
* [ ] Connect bi-variate correlation to what is meant by a principal component
* [ ] Summarize the curse of dimensionality and how it relates to data science
* [ ] Explain the dangers of using unsupervised machine learning
* [ ] Give examples of how many answers could result from doing an unsupervised machine learning analysis with different choices made by the data scientist
* [ ] Interpret the outcome of running the example PCA
* [ ] Critize the advantages and disadvantages of using PCA
