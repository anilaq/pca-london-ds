Data Reduction 

* Unsupervised Learning 
* Curse of Dimensonality

PCA 

* Linear Combinations of Variables 
* Get many correlations, reduce down 
* How to interpret dimensions 

Running PCA

* Import PCA
* Scale Data
* PC explain all variance
* Cumsum will add them all up

WTF PCA?
	Unsupervised Learning
		How many scatter plots can you even make (p. 375)
		Low Dimensional Representation of the Data 
		Applied Cases 
		Examples
	Supervised vs Unsupervised Discussion
		Applied Cases 
	Curse of Dimensionality 
		Interview Question
	Use Case 
		Mismeasure of Man
		Intelligence: G
		Personality: Big Five
		Personality: Meyers Briggs
		Reification
	Understanding Dataset? New Ideas?  
		Regression
		"Clustering" / Segmentation
Dependancy of Data 
	Data Defines the Space 
High Level What is Going On
	Big Old Correlation Matrix
	Look for Vectors to Pull Out
